# 💨 Fart Simulator

**Fart Simulator** is a unique and humorous action game developed in Unity, where flatulence becomes your ultimate weapon. Set in a medieval kingdom, you play as a gassy hero who must defeat citizens, guards, and the mighty King using the power of your... *you guessed it* — farts.
